You have to have been living under a rock these past few years to have not heard speak of two big things in technology: cryptocurrency and AI. Even if you were under a rock you might now have avoided it.

In my mind the applications of cryptocurrencies are overblown - most of the problems it solves can be solved more efficiently in other fashions to say nothing of the [environmental impact](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shermanlee/2018/04/19/bitcoins-energy-consumption-can-power-an-entire-country-but-eos-is-trying-to-fix-that/#33d9f3851bc8) it has. 

AI, on the other hand, holds a great deal of promise. We're spending a great deal of time solving very complex programming problems which could be solved algorithmically instead. Building a chess playing computer is stunningly difficult but building one which learns to play chess by playing against copies of itself is easier. That's how humans learn and it's worked out pretty well for us so far.

My problem is that I don't know AI from a hill of beans.

Today I'm hoping to start changing that by going on an adventure to learn about AI and how I can use it. My starting point is that I took a course in university so long ago that our examples were all about AIs to design pyramids. In other words: I know nothing. I've found I learn best when I have to explain what I've learned to others hence this blog. 

Come along with me on my adventure.
